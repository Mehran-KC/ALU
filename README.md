# ALU Program

This is a simple ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) program implemented in C++. The program allows the user to perform various operations on binary numbers, including conversion to decimal, addition, subtraction, logical shifting, bitwise operations, increment, and decrement.

## Features

- Decimal to Binary Conversion: Convert a decimal number to binary format.
- Add: Perform binary addition of two numbers.
- Subtract: Perform binary subtraction of two numbers.
- Logical Shift Right: Perform logical right shift on a binary number.
- Logical Shift Left: Perform logical left shift on a binary number.
- Bitwise AND: Perform bitwise AND operation on two binary numbers.
- Bitwise OR: Perform bitwise OR operation on two binary numbers.
- Bitwise NOT: Perform bitwise NOT operation on a binary number.
- Bitwise XOR: Perform bitwise XOR operation on two binary numbers.
- Bitwise NAND: Perform bitwise NAND operation on two binary numbers.
- Bitwise NOR: Perform bitwise NOR operation on two binary numbers.
- Bitwise XNOR: Perform bitwise XNOR operation on two binary numbers.
- Increment: Increment a binary number by 1.
- Decrement: Decrement a binary number by 1.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
   for example in ** Windows ** you can install g++ and type 
   ```
   g++ ALU.cpp
   ```
   and run it with 
   ```
   a.exe
   ```
4. Run the compiled executable.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to select an operation and provide the required inputs.
6. The program will display the results in both binary and decimal formats.

## Dependencies

The program does not have any external dependencies and only requires a C++ compiler to compile and run.

# Important 
Folder Include (Header) should be in same folder with project.
